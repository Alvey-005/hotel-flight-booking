#About the project
this is a simple hotel -flight booking website build using nextJs, tailwind, Shadcn/UI 
there are 4 input field, 2 of them are mendorty, the last one has defult value, 
i tried to pass the form value as page param so that i dont need state to handle it and it can be share able, as states got vanished after reload, this way sharing the link can be shared the whole search result, as i had no access to api i created a dummy json and returend it, i am just filterering based on location, copy any loaction and search for it, 
for time constrain i wan unable to implement the flight booking here, and no search found is not handled too
